# E9X-M-CAN-Integration-Module
 
I designed this module to integrate additional functionality into my '08 E92 335i.
With full access to the K-CAN, PT-CAN and D-CAN, functionality can be added, modified or suppressed. This enables the use of FXX modules and radios, MDrive and more.
While the code is quite specific for my particular car, much of the CAN message logic may be useful.
Included are also tools to allow full manipulation of the program section in the MSD81 bin file.


**Electronics used:**
 
* Skpang Triple CAN board https://copperhilltech.com/teensy-4-0-triple-can-bus-board-with-two-can-2-0b-and-one-can-fd-port/ (Teensy 4.0, MCP2562s).
* MCP2515 board for NBT emulation.
* Small copper heatsink.
* N-channel MOSFET that can be driven with 3V3. I had some FQP50N06Ls.

* Move driver's seat back when exiting car.
* Indicate when the trunk is opened by remote (flash hazards).
	* Visual signal for locking/unlocking must be ON.
* Indicate when the car is locked and the lock button is pressed (flash hazards).
	* Car must be locked for at least 10s and Visual signal for locking/unlocking must be ON.
* Force sleep mode (KL30G OFF) by holding remote lock button for 20s - for testing.
* Immobilize the engine with a fuel pump cut-off until the M button is pressed X times.
	* If engine is started without releasing this immobilizer, alarm will sound once engine stalls.
	* Can be disabled persistently by first deactivating then, holding the POWER and DSC OFF buttons for 10s with the ignition ON.
* Display Front fog lights ON (for M3 clusters that lack the symbol).
* Audibly warn when reverse gear is engaged.
* Audibly warn when the hood is opened.
* Create a HDC function similar to the one in xDrive cars.
* Display a CC error when pressing the Auto Start-stop button instead of a blank button.
  OR
* Switch on the reversing camera when pressing the Auto Start-stop button.
* Carry out one more wipe cycle after washing the windscreen.
* Have intermittent wipers work alongside rain sensing.
	* Push the stalk down and hold for 1.3s to turn on intermittent mode.
	* AUTO, stalk pushed up 1 and stalk pushed up 2 disable intermittent mode.
* Enable use of FXX K-CAN1 controller with CIC.
* Enable use of FXX VSW01 (VideoSWitch) module with NBT.
* Enable use of FXX NIVI2/3 module.
* Enable full diagnosis and coding of SVT70 module.
* Turn on heated seats below a set temperature.
* Turn on heated steering below a set temperature.
* Automatically turn off PDC when parked and pulling handbrake.
* Automatically activate tow view rear view camera option when close to an obstacle.
* Close the exhaust flap before engine start to reduce start noise.
* Reduce audio volume when opening doors. Restore when closing.
* Dim corresponding front DRL when indicator is on.
* Turn on corresponding front fog light when steering angle threshold is exceeded.

**Program:**

Message transmission is optimized to reach the receiver module on the shortest route. I.e. messages that need to reach KOMBI are sent on K-CAN even if the BMW implementation would have sent it over PT-CAN. This is done to bypass any gateway (JBE) delays.
Functions that make use of CANID 0x6F1 (iDrive volume, SVT_70 gateway, etc.) are deactivated if communication on D-CAN from an OBD tool is detected.
FiFo queues are implemented to ensure reading and processing of messages is not blocked by delays.
A serial interface with a set of commands is implemented to allow manipulation during runtime. The default password to unlock it is "coldboot". "help" prints the available commands.


**Arduino IDE settings:**

Board: Teensy 4.0  
Optimize: Fastest with LTO  
CPU Speed: 396 MHz  
USB Type: Dual Serial for debugging, Single for normal operation.  


To make some startup time critical functions work, the following changes should be made to startup.c:  
(Linux path: /home/**Username**/.arduino15/packages/teensy/hardware/avr/**Version**/cores/teensy4/startup.c)  
Comment these lines:  
	usb_pll_start();  
	while (millis() < TEENSY_INIT_USB_DELAY_BEFORE) ;  
	usb_init();  
	while (millis() < TEENSY_INIT_USB_DELAY_AFTER + TEENSY_INIT_USB_DELAY_BEFORE) ; // wait  
  
Optionally, modify usb.c:  
Comment:  
	delay(25);  



**MSD81 IKM0S binary modification:**

[PROGRAM]

0x83738   and  0x83739  -> 1F 03      (CAN message table)  
0x1F3AD4  and  0x1F3AD5 -> 1F 03      (CAN filters)  

Replace 15 03 (0x315 represented in Little Endian) to stop MSD81 from reacting to Vehicle Mode changes (triggered by JBBF through EDC button).  
This also allows state_spt (throttle map) to be controlled independently from the main "MDrive" with the console switch.  
Alternatively, this XDF contains definitions for the CAN IDs: https://github.com/superwofy/Superwofy-IKM0S-XDF.  
Re-calculate checksum at 0x80304 using csprogram-windows.exe.  



[MAP]

lc_var_spt_swi at 0x4CD1D set to 00. This disables the DME 1M MDrive logic. 0x399, 0x1D9 etc.  
By default the DME hard-codes the MDrive values for Servotronic, EDC etc. In order to replace them, these functions need to be disabled.
